# Magento 2 - Blank theme - SASS version

## Want to help?
If you want to contribute, please go to `develop` branch, check issues and pull requests.

## Current status
This is copy of `Magento/blank` theme copied from `pub/static` after `bin/magento dev:source-theme:deploy`

Code is converted via `less2sass` node.js script and few files are manually edited to be fully SASS compatible.

Use `gulp` default task to test if code compile.

If are you sure that `scss` file works, remove `less` file with same name.
